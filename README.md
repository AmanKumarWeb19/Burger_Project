Tailwind CSS Setup:- (https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation)

Tailwind css has few methods of setup, Here I used Tailwind CLI. This is very easy and fastest way to set up and starting with Tailwind CSS from scratch.


SECTIONS:-

It is really important to include your content in different sections to show a clear and engaging user experience 
So I created few sections like navigation, hero section, category section, promo section, about section, menu section, review section, contact section and footer section.


Active Link:- 

Creating an “active link” feature is very essential for users. It makes easier to understand a user which section the user is currently staying in.
When a user clicks on a navigation link, the link becomes active and change to a different style. 
To achieve this, We use javascript.


Responsive Design:

Responsive website design is a web design way to create web pages render well. 
It is the practice of creating a website fitting to work on every screen size and every device and no matter how large or small, mobile or desktop. In Tailwind CSS, 
it’s very easy to build a responsive design so we were able to build a fully responsive burger website perfectly.
