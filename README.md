# Burger_Project

Welcome to the Burger_Project, a website built with Tailwind CSS that offers a delightful user experience, combining sleek design, active navigation, responsive layouts, and interactive features.

## Tailwind CSS Setup

We've utilized the Tailwind CLI for a quick and easy setup. Refer to the [Tailwind CSS documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) for detailed installation instructions.

## Sections

Our website is organized into several sections to enhance user engagement:

- **Navigation:** Easy-to-navigate menu bar to explore different sections.
- **Hero Section:** A captivating introduction to the Burger_Project.
- **Category Section:** Categorization of burgers for quick selection.
- **Promo Section:** Special promotions and offers.
- **About Section:** Information about the Burger_Project and its mission.
- **Menu Section:** Detailed menu with mouthwatering burger options.
- **Review Section:** Customer testimonials and reviews.
- **Contact Section:** Contact information and a form for inquiries.
- **Footer Section:** Important links, social media handles, and additional details.

## Active Link

We've implemented an "active link" feature using JavaScript. When users click on a navigation link, the link changes style, indicating the current section.

## Responsive Design

The Burger_Project website is designed to be fully responsive, ensuring a seamless user experience across various devices and screen sizes.

## Dark/Light Mode

Users can choose between dark and light mode themes according to their preference, enhancing accessibility and user comfort.

## Scroll Up Button

A convenient "scroll up" button appears as users scroll down. Clicking the button smoothly takes users back to the top of the page.

## Scroll Reveal Animation

We've integrated scroll animations that trigger when elements come into view during scrolling. This enhances the user experience by providing subtle and engaging visual effects.

## Tab-based Filtering

Our website incorporates tab-based filtering, allowing users to sort and filter items efficiently. Clicking different tabs dynamically updates the displayed items, improving the user's browsing experience.
