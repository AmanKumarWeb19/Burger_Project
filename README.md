Tailwind CSS Setup:- (https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation)

Tailwind css has few methods of setup, Here I used Tailwind CLI. This is very easy and fastest way to set up and starting with Tailwind CSS from scratch.


SECTIONS :-

It is really important to include your content in different sections to show a clear and engaging user experience 
So I created few sections like navigation, hero section, category section, promo section, about section, menu section, review section, contact section and footer section.


Active Link :- 

Creating an “active link” feature is very essential for users. It makes easier to understand a user which section the user is currently staying in.
When a user clicks on a navigation link, the link becomes active and change to a different style. 
To achieve this, We use javascript.


Responsive Design :-

Responsive website design is a web design way to create web pages render well. 
It is the practice of creating a website fitting to work on every screen size and every device and no matter how large or small, mobile or desktop. In Tailwind CSS, 
it’s very easy to build a responsive design so we were able to build a fully responsive burger website perfectly.



Dark/Light Mode :-

we have added dark mode and light mode themes so users can choose what they like.


Scroll Up Button :-

We created a button called scroll up button. If you scroll down a bit that button will appear and if you click on that button it will take you to the top.


Scroll Reveal Animation :-

Creating scroll animation feature is very essential for users. 
Scroll animations are the animation taking place while the user scrolls up or down a website. 
Essentially the scrolling animation is activated when the element comes into view.


Tab-based filtering :-

we created Tab-based filtering which is an effective way to allow users to sort and filter items on your website.
When users click on different tabs, the displayed items change accordingly.
