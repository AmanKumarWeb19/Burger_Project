Tailwind CSS Setup:- https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation
Tailwind css has few methods of setup, Here I used Tailwind CLI. This is very easy and fastest way to set up and starting with Tailwind CSS from scratch.

SECTIONS:-
It is really important to include your content in different sections to show a clear and engaging user experience 
So I created few sections like navigation, hero section, category section, promo section, about section, menu section, review section, contact section and footer section.
