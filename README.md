Tailwind CSS Setup:- (https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation)
Tailwind css has few methods of setup, Here I used Tailwind CLI. This is very easy and fastest way to set up and starting with Tailwind CSS from scratch.


SECTIONS:-
It is really important to include your content in different sections to show a clear and engaging user experience 
So I created few sections like navigation, hero section, category section, promo section, about section, menu section, review section, contact section and footer section.


Active Link: Creating an “active link” feature is very essential for users. It makes easier to understand a user which section the user is currently staying in.
When a user clicks on a navigation link, the link becomes active and change to a different style. 
To achieve this, We use javascript.
